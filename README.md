# Fuzzy-based Deep Attributed Graph Clustering

This is a Tensorflow implementation of the Fuzzy-based Deep Attributed Graph Clustering (FDAGC)

### Brief Description

Our experiments are mainly conducted on citation datasets and social datasets.

For these two types of datasets, Cora dataset and Facebook dataset are taken as examples to demonstrate in the code. 

### Requirements

* TensorFlow 2.0
* python 3.6
* numpy
* network 2.3
* scipy 1.5
* scikit-learn 0.22

### Running

For Cora dataset: 
```
python train_cora.py
```


For Facebook dataset: 
```
python train_facebook.py
```

### Evaluation Results

All results can be viewed in the result directory.
